## <a name="uguide"></a>Users' Guide

MetaT is a wrapper tool for fast and simple preprocessing of NGS transcriptomics 
data, combining the most recent and fastest software currently available in a 
user-friendly format. The general workflow of the MetaT wrapper tool is:
```sh
# QC of reads.
MetaT readprep -i samples -t 40

# Annotate assembly.
MetaT annotation -a assembly.fasta -o annotation.fasta -t

# Map reads to annotated assembly.
MetaT mapping -i RNAreads -a anotation.fasta -o counts.txt -t 40
```
**Importantly**, the pipeline is only setup to handle transcriptomics data from
a 50bp SR illumina library. Furhtermore, the annotation database are only setup 
for Bacteria at the moment.

### <a name="cite"></a>Citing MetaT

As MetaT still is in development, no citing is available.

## <a name="limit"></a>Limitations

MetaT is developed for a very specific purpose: 

* Mapping 50bp SR illumina reads to annotated microbial metagenomes.

All other usecases you're on your own!
